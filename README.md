# whosonfirst

whosonfirst is a tool used for importing [Who's On First data]() from local files into a Pelias ElasticSearch repository.

# Usage

```bash
$> npm start
```

# Types

Currently, the only supported types are:

- continent
- country
- county
- dependency
- disputed
- localadmin
- locality
- macrocounty
- macroregion
- neighbourhood
- region

Other types may be included in the future.  

# Configuration

The sole Pelias configuration option available is `imports.whosonfirst.datapath`.  It should point to the root of where Who's On First data has been downloaded.  

There are multiple ways to download Who's On First data and at this time the only supported directory layout is that generated by performing `git clone https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-data.git`.  The expected layout is:

```bash
./data/<the nested structure of .geojson files>
./meta/<all the .csv meta files>
```

Alternatively, the bundles can be downloaded from [https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/bundles/] and converted to the above structure.
