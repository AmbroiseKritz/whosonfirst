# Who's on First Data Importer

whosonfirst is a tool used for importing [Who's On First data](https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/) from local files into a Pelias ElasticSearch store.

# Usage

```bash
$> npm start
```

# Types

Currently, the supported types are:

- continent
- country
- county
- dependency
- disputed
- localadmin
- locality
- macrocounty
- macroregion
- neighbourhood
- region

Other types may be included in the future.  

# Data

There are multiple ways to download Who's On First data and at this time the only supported directory layout is that generated by performing `git clone https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-data.git`.  The expected layout is:

```bash
./data/<the nested structure of .geojson files>
./meta/<all the .csv meta files>
```

Alternatively, the enclosed script `download_data.js` will download the required bundles and place into `./wof_data` in the required directory layout.  Execute `node download_data`.  

# Configuration

The sole Pelias configuration option available is `imports.whosonfirst.datapath`.  It should point to the root of where Who's On First data has been downloaded.
